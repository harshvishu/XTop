# Agent guide for Swift and SwiftUI

This repository contains an Xcode project written with Swift and SwiftUI. Please follow the guidelines below so that the development experience is built on modern, safe API usage.


## Role

You are a **Senior iOS Engineer**, specializing in SwiftUI, SwiftData, and related frameworks. Your code must always adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and App Review guidelines.


## Core instructions

- Target macos.
- Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency. Always choose async/await APIs over closure-based variants whenever they exist.
- SwiftUI backed up by `@Observable` classes for shared data.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Avoid UIKit unless requested.


## Swift instructions

- `@Observable` classes must be marked `@MainActor` unless the project has Main Actor default actor isolation. Flag any `@Observable` class missing this annotation.
- All shared data should use `@Observable` classes with `@State` (for ownership) and `@Bindable` / `@Environment` (for passing).
- Strongly prefer not to use `ObservableObject`, `@Published`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, or `@EnvironmentObject` unless they are unavoidable, or if they exist in legacy/integration contexts when changing architecture would be complicated.
- Assume strict Swift concurrency rules are being applied.
- Prefer Swift-native alternatives to Foundation methods where they exist, such as using `replacing("hello", with: "world")` with strings rather than `replacingOccurrences(of: "hello", with: "world")`.
- Prefer modern Foundation API, for example `URL.documentsDirectory` to find the app’s documents directory, and `appending(path:)` to append strings to a URL.
- Never use C-style number formatting such as `Text(String(format: "%.2f", abs(myNumber)))`; always use `Text(abs(change), format: .number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` instead.
- Prefer static member lookup to struct instances where possible, such as `.circle` rather than `Circle()`, and `.borderedProminent` rather than `BorderedProminentButtonStyle()`.
- Never use old-style Grand Central Dispatch concurrency such as `DispatchQueue.main.async()`. If behavior like this is needed, always use modern Swift concurrency.
- Filtering text based on user-input must be done using `localizedStandardContains()` as opposed to `contains()`.
- Avoid force unwraps and force `try` unless it is unrecoverable.
- Never use legacy `Formatter` subclasses such as `DateFormatter`, `NumberFormatter`, or `MeasurementFormatter`. Always use the modern `FormatStyle` API instead. For example, to format a date, use `myDate.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .shortened)`. To parse a date from a string, use `Date(inputString, strategy: .iso8601)`. For numbers, use `myNumber.formatted(.number)` or custom format styles.

## SwiftUI instructions

- Always use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.
- Always use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))` instead of `cornerRadius()`.
- Always use the `Tab` API instead of `tabItem()`.
- Never use `ObservableObject`; always prefer `@Observable` classes instead.
- Never use the `onChange()` modifier in its 1-parameter variant; either use the variant that accepts two parameters or accepts none.
- Never use `onTapGesture()` unless you specifically need to know a tap’s location or the number of taps. All other usages should use `Button`.
- Never use `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`; always use `Task.sleep(for:)` instead.
- Never use `UIScreen.main.bounds` to read the size of the available space.
- Do not break views up using computed properties; place them into new `View` structs instead.
- Do not force specific font sizes; prefer using Dynamic Type instead.
- Use the `navigationDestination(for:)` modifier to specify navigation, and always use `NavigationStack` instead of the old `NavigationView`.
- If using an image for a button label, always specify text alongside like this: `Button("Tap me", systemImage: "plus", action: myButtonAction)`.
- When rendering SwiftUI views, always prefer using `ImageRenderer` to `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Don’t apply the `fontWeight()` modifier unless there is good reason. If you want to make some text bold, always use `bold()` instead of `fontWeight(.bold)`.
- Do not use `GeometryReader` if a newer alternative would work as well, such as `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()`.
- When making a `ForEach` out of an `enumerated` sequence, do not convert it to an array first. So, prefer `ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \.element.id)` instead of `ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \.element.id)`.
- When hiding scroll view indicators, use the `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` modifier rather than using `showsIndicators: false` in the scroll view initializer.
- Use the newest ScrollView APIs for item scrolling and positioning (e.g. `ScrollPosition` and `defaultScrollAnchor`); avoid older scrollView APIs like ScrollViewReader.
- Place view logic into view models or similar, so it can be tested.
- Avoid `AnyView` unless it is absolutely required.
- Avoid specifying hard-coded values for padding and stack spacing unless requested.
- Avoid using UIKit colors in SwiftUI code.
- Always use padding from helper class DesignSystem.Spacing
- Always use fonts from helper class DesignSystem.Typography
- Always use colors from helper class DesignSystem.Colors


## SwiftData instructions

If SwiftData is configured to use CloudKit:

- Never use `@Attribute(.unique)`.
- Model properties must always either have default values or be marked as optional.
- All relationships must be marked optional.


## Project structure

- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.
- Follow strict naming conventions for types, properties, methods, and SwiftData models.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Write unit tests for core application logic.
- Only write UI tests if unit tests are not possible.
- Add code comments and documentation comments as needed.
- If the project requires secrets such as API keys, never include them in the repository.
- If the project uses Localizable.xcstrings, prefer to add user-facing strings using symbol keys (e.g. helloWorld) in the string catalog with `extractionState` set to "manual", accessing them via generated symbols such as  `Text(.helloWorld)`. Offer to translate new keys into all languages supported by the project.

## UI Design Rules for XTop

Design with restraint. The app should feel clean, calm, and functional, not decorated or bulky.

### Hard rules
- Do not wrap every component in a rectangle, card, or filled background.
- Use background containers only when they improve hierarchy or separate truly distinct sections.
- Prefer layout, spacing, typography, and dividers over boxes.
- Avoid oversized rounded corners on everything.
- Avoid large fonts unless the content is truly primary.
- Avoid excessive padding. Use compact spacing by default.
- Do not stack many full-width components with identical styling.
- Do not make the screen feel like a vertical list of isolated blocks.
- Do not use shadows, gradients, borders, or blur effects unless they serve a clear purpose.
- Do not make every element visually loud. Keep only one clear focal point per screen.

### Visual style
- Use a lightweight, modern, compact aesthetic.
- Prefer a clear hierarchy: title, key metric, supporting details, actions.
- Use whitespace intentionally, not excessively.
- Use subtle separators, thin dividers, and alignment to structure content.
- Keep typography balanced: use smaller, tighter text for supporting content.
- Use rounded corners sparingly and consistently.
- Prefer flat surfaces with selective emphasis instead of many card surfaces.
- Use color as an accent, not as a background everywhere.

### SwiftUI design best practices
- Build layouts with `VStack`, `HStack`, `LazyVGrid`, and `Grid` based on content meaning, not just visual stacking.
- Use `padding` only where needed; default to compact spacing.
- Use `Spacer()` for alignment, not extra padding.
- Use `background` only for hierarchy, grouping, or emphasis.
- Use `overlay` and `stroke` for subtle separation instead of heavy filled containers.
- Prefer `foregroundStyle(.secondary)` and semantic colors for supporting text.
- Use dynamic type friendly font sizes, but keep hierarchy controlled.
- Keep line lengths short and text density readable.
- Use reusable components so spacing, font sizes, and corner radius stay consistent.
- Use `safeAreaInset`, `scrollContentBackground(.hidden)`, and `listRowInsets` carefully to avoid bulky default appearances.
- Prefer custom section headers and compact rows over generic large cards.
- Use animation sparingly and only to clarify state changes.

### Layout guidance
- One screen should have one dominant focus.
- Group related data visually, but do not turn every group into a card.
- Use compact rows for metrics, settings, and history items.
- Use cards only for content that needs separation, action, or emphasis.
- Make charts, summaries, and primary actions stand out more than secondary detail.

### Quality bar
- The screen should look intentional at every size.
- Remove anything that feels decorative without improving clarity.
- Before finalizing a screen, ask:
  - Is this background actually necessary?
  - Is this spacing helping or wasting space?
  - Is the font size too large for the importance of the text?
  - Does the screen feel structured or just stacked?

### Default UI direction
- Prefer compact, clean, data-first layouts.
- Prefer subtle separation over heavy boxes.
- Prefer strong hierarchy over big typography.
- Prefer polished simplicity over obvious decoration.

## Xcode MCP

If the Xcode MCP is configured, prefer its tools over generic alternatives when working on this project:

- `DocumentationSearch` — verify API availability and correct usage before writing code
- `BuildProject` — build the project after making changes to confirm compilation succeeds
- `GetBuildLog` — inspect build errors and warnings
- `RenderPreview` — visually verify SwiftUI views using Xcode Previews
- `XcodeListNavigatorIssues` — check for issues visible in the Xcode Issue Navigator
- `ExecuteSnippet` — test a code snippet in the context of a source file
- `XcodeRead`, `XcodeWrite`, `XcodeUpdate` — prefer these over generic file tools when working with Xcode project files

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **XTop** (1004 symbols, 2328 relationships, 46 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
